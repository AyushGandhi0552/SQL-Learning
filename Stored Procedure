What is a Stored Procedure (SP)?
A Stored Procedure is a set of SQL statements that are saved in the database and can be reused whenever needed.
It is like a function in programming: you call it, and it performs a task (e.g., inserting data, retrieving records, updating tables).

=>Why Use SPs?
Reduces repetition of code.
Improves performance by reducing query parsing.
Adds security by hiding SQL logic.

Types of Stored Procedures
SQL Server categorizes the stored procedures mainly in two types:
User-defined Stored Procedures
System Stored Procedures

1. User-Defined Stored Procedures
These are procedures created by users to perform specific tasks. They are written using SQL and stored in the database for reuse.
Key Features:
Created by users for customized tasks (e.g., insert, update, retrieve data).
Stored in the database schema and can be executed multiple times.
Can accept input and output parameters.
